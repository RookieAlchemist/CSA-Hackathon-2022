# Space Apps 2022 Hackathon - Space Survival Mission

The Space Apps 2022 Hackathon submission from Abdullah Mustafa and Ahmad Arain, taking on the second challenge, *Space Survival Adventure*, Stargazer difficulty.

We made a game where you play as an astronaut in a spaceship 100 years into the future. Run around the spaceship, look for documents (read them closely) and complete missions as you learn about the hazards of space operations and space travel.

To play the game, run the [main file](src/Main.java).

### Commands
Press `A` and `D` to move left and right.
Press `W` when on a portal to teleport.
Press `E` when next to a scroll (hint: there are 3 of them). Scroll scrolls using the `S` and `W` keys.
When doing a mission, use the `H`, `J`, `K` and `L` keys.
